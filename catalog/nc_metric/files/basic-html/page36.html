The fit and finish was perfection at its best.     The installation for me was about 30 minutes. I only have one com-               (877-972-7336)     plaint. After the shield was put on I had to take it for a test ride. The     problem is that I cook dinner and the shield worked so well I had a     hard time coming home. Ended up eating a sandwich. My 5"7" frame                           or     gave me no wind buffeting. The change from no shield to SwitchBlade     shield was best by more then 100%. Thanks again!”                                 708-343-0400      ~ Phil Crudo     “While riding to work on my 1996 Kawasaki Vulcan 750, I was hit in     the windshield by a 165-pound deer. It had been hit by an oncoming     SUV and thrown, airborne, into my lane. It was high enough to clear     the bike headlight, so my National Cycle Heavy Duty™ windshield            info@nationalcycle.com     took the entire force of the impact. The windshield flexed and did     break on the left side, but sent the body of the deer flying over my     head. The impact pushed my handlebars down 3 inches and broke the          www.nationalcycle.com     left mirror but kept the deer off me. I maintained control and didn't     even lay the bike down! After stopping the bike and collecting my     thoughts, I rode back home, got online, and ordered an exact replace-     ment windshield (which was delivered three days later). I immediately     mounted it on the bike, along with a new set of mirrors. When you     find something this good, I think you'd better stay with it!”      ~ Satisfied Customer     “I own a Honda Valkyrie with one of your Heavy Duty™ Windshields. I     was traveling across the Howard Franklin Bridge in Tampa, Florida     when a vehicle directly in front of me had a ball peen hammer fall     from it and hit the pavement ahead of me. I had absolutely no time to     execute any sort of evasive action. The hammer bounced up and hit     my windshield dead center just above the crossbar at around 75MPH.     Thanks to the durability of that shield, myself and my passenger were     unhurt! The shield absorbed the impact and deflected the hammer     away. A further testament to the durability of your product is that,     upon later inspection, the windshield had sustained no damage, not     even a scratch! This was a $200 product that in all likelihood saved     my life and the life of my passenger.     “I assure you that in any future windshield purchases, I will accept     nothing but a National Cycle windshield. A tremendous thanks to your     company and to your design and manufacturing people... I owe them     my life!”      ~ Jeff Byers     “Took my bike to the dealer for my 5000 mile service and the     Peacemakers exhausts were the talk of the shop. The service rep said     he had shown them to several people throughout the day and they all     thought they were great. Hope they last a long time, because they are     nice to have since I work at a high school and ride to work on the     bike when ever possible. I roar all the way to work, then quietly slip     into the parking lot... it's great!”      ~ Rolland Cook     “I just wanted to comment on your Peacemaker® Slip-Ons. About     three weeks ago, I put on a pair of your Peacemaker Slip-Ons, and I     have to say that theses are the best exhaust mufflers I’ve ever had on     any of my bikes. The deep, throaty rumble is just perfect to the     eardrum, but it is not the usual loud and annoying sound of other sys-     tems. The quiet mode is perfect, because I work at a hospital and I     can just cruise through the parking lot with no complaints. Thanks a     million for such a wonderful exhaust system.”      ~ Cristobal Colon
