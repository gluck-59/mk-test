Wing Riders: you told us and     we responded. You told us you wanted a deflector plastic     that would not break, a deflector that would stay in your set     position (even at speed), and a bracket that would not     loosen at the joints.     We proudly introduce the Wing Deflector™ from National     Cycle!     Our Wing Deflectors are made from Lexan® polycarbonate     and CNC routed for smooth radiuses on all edges. Then     each piece is formed with a wind control edge and FMR     hardcoated for long lasting scratch resistance.     Wing Deflectors are strong and will stay great looking for as     long as you have them on your bike!     Wing Deflectors allow maximum temperature control of     airflow toward or away from the rider. National Cycle’s     unique Swivel Ratchets allow each Deflector to be incre-     mentally adjusted by hand for personalized temperature     control. No tools required!     These Wing Deflectors are fully road worthy and, once     adjusted, they stay in place even at highway speeds.     A unique one-piece steel bracket is designed for maximum     strength and chrome plated for a beautiful finish. There are     no joints in National Cycle’s brackets, so they can not move     out of adjustment.     Installation is easy. Two access holes are drilled into the     fairing strip using a provided drill bit and template which     gains access to the threaded inserts provided by Honda®.     Stainless steel fasteners are the finishing touch to hold the     Wing Deflectors securely in place.     Wing Deflectors come with National Cycle’s 3-Year Warranty     against breakage!

VStream Windscreens are     constructed from thick,     durable polycarbonate and     are coated with our exclu-     sive Quantum™ hardcoat or     FMR hardcoat (depending     on model application).

Does the riding season     seem too short?     National Cycle Hand Deflectors are an easy-to-install     solution for keeping your hands warm and dry. Coupled with     a windshield, Hand Deflectors protect your entire upper     body from cold wind and rain.     Hand Deflectors mount easily and securely to your bike’s     mirror mounts, yet allow plenty of room for lever movement     and for riders with large gloves. These hand deflectors     make a windshield function like a fairing.

They extend the riding season when winter     gloves are just not enough. They also make heated grips     work more effectively.      “I just installed a set of National Cycle Hand Deflectors for my      1100 Shadow Spirit, and rode to work. It’s 29 degrees this      morning, but no problem for me. I ride year-round and on days      like this I find myself constantly flexing my fingers to keep      from freezing. Not now. INCREDIBLE! I love it! I made the trip      (38 miles one way), and didn’t even think about my hands.      “This is one of the best investments I’ve made, and I am going      to tell every rider I know or see on the road about your Hand      Deflectors. Thank you, thank you!”       ~ Alan Sinquefield     Applications for Hand Deflectors will vary depending     on make and model of motorcycle.

Cold wind blasts can rapidly cool your body temperature     and reduce your riding time. If the outside temperature is     30 degrees Fahrenheit and you're riding at a speed of 50     mph, the wind chill temperature that your body will feel     is 12 degrees Fahrenheit.     The National Weather Service implemented a replace-     ment Wind Chill Temperature (WCT) index several years     ago. The new formula uses advances in science, technol-     ogy, and computer modeling to give everyone a more     accurate and useful formula for calculating the dangers     from winds. Our chart is based on the new WCT formula.     16                               M o d e l - s p e c i f i c a p p l i c a t i o n s : v i s i t y o u r]]></page><page Index="17"><![CDATA[     Spotlight Bars and Chrome     Lower Deflectors     National Cycle Spotlight Bars not only look great on your     cruiser, they are also a considerable safety feature.

An updated, sporting design offers a level of wind protection     that meets and exceeds even top-of-the-line touring bikes.     Ingenious lower wind deflectors noticeably cut down turbu-     lence, noise and buffeting behind the shield.

It had been hit by an oncoming     SUV and thrown, airborne, into my lane. It was high enough to clear     the bike headlight, so my National Cycle Heavy Duty™ windshield            info@nationalcycle.com     took the entire force of the impact. The windshield flexed and did     break on the left side, but sent the body of the deer flying over my     head. The impact pushed my handlebars down 3 inches and broke the          www.nationalcycle.com     left mirror but kept the deer off me. I maintained control and didn't     even lay the bike down! After stopping the bike and collecting my     thoughts, I rode back home, got online, and ordered an exact replace-     ment windshield (which was delivered three days later). I immediately     mounted it on the bike, along with a new set of mirrors. When you     find something this good, I think you'd better stay with it!”      ~ Satisfied Customer     “I own a Honda Valkyrie with one of your Heavy Duty™ Windshields. I     was traveling across the Howard Franklin Bridge in Tampa, Florida     when a vehicle directly in front of me had a ball peen hammer fall     from it and hit the pavement ahead of me. I had absolutely no time to     execute any sort of evasive action. The hammer bounced up and hit     my windshield dead center just above the crossbar at around 75MPH.     Thanks to the durability of that shield, myself and my passenger were     unhurt! The shield absorbed the impact and deflected the hammer     away. A further testament to the durability of your product is that,     upon later inspection, the windshield had sustained no damage, not     even a scratch! This was a $200 product that in all likelihood saved     my life and the life of my passenger.     “I assure you that in any future windshield purchases, I will accept     nothing but a National Cycle windshield. A tremendous thanks to your     company and to your design and manufacturing people... I owe them     my life!”      ~ Jeff Byers     “Took my bike to the dealer for my 5000 mile service and the     Peacemakers exhausts were the talk of the shop. The service rep said     he had shown them to several people throughout the day and they all     thought they were great. Hope they last a long time, because they are     nice to have since I work at a high school and ride to work on the     bike when ever possible. I roar all the way to work, then quietly slip     into the parking lot... it's great!”      ~ Rolland Cook     “I just wanted to comment on your Peacemaker® Slip-Ons. About     three weeks ago, I put on a pair of your Peacemaker Slip-Ons, and I     have to say that theses are the best exhaust mufflers I’ve ever had on     any of my bikes. The deep, throaty rumble is just perfect to the     eardrum, but it is not the usual loud and annoying sound of other sys-     tems. The quiet mode is perfect, because I work at a hospital and I     can just cruise through the parking lot with no complaints. Thanks a     million for such a wonderful exhaust system.”      ~ Cristobal Colon]]></page></pages></Search>
