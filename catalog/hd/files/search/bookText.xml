QUICK-RELEASE SUPER SPORT WINDSHIELD        Reduces the pounding of wind and shower of bugs but keeps        the wind-in-the-hair feeling. Ideal for a cool morning ride, the        sleek profile of the Super Sport Windshield hugs the front        headlamp for a sporty look. The windshield mounts to the fork        tubes with elegant die-cast lever locking clamps, so the wind-        shield does not require any “leave-behind” docking hardware.        You get quick on-and-off convenience and a clean, custom        look. No tools are required and the kit includes everything        needed to install the windshield.        57400192   Light Smoke.         $314.95        Fits ’15-later XG models.

Harley-Davidson  LED Lamps are                                  ®        brighter and whiter in color and provide a superior light pattern        over standard incandescent lamps. Compared to the yellow        light of a traditional halogen bulb, the LED lamp produces a        “Daylight Color Impression” that appears more natural to the        user. Headlamps feature horizontal “D-shaped” lenses that        focus light into a pool in front of the motorcycle and sepa-        rate high beam and low beam projector lenses that provide        a focused beam of light ahead. Lamps are available in your        choice of brilliant chrome or gloss black background to match        your styling direction. The solid-state LEDs are designed for        long life and the shock- and vibration-resistant lamp assembly        mounts into existing light housings. Installation is quick and        easy and the plug-in lamps connect to the factory headlamp        wiring. The LED lamps are DOT and ECE compliant.

CAFÉ SOLO SEAT        There’s something about the placement of the rider that        makes the Cafe Solo Seat special. The one-up design and        the high back pad hold the rider in place and provide a direct        connection to the bike. You sit “in” the bike and your hands and        feet reach naturally to the controls. The low-slung pad, narrow        nose and the tapered tail enhance the bike’s sporting profile        and pays homage to the heritage of the iconic Café Racer style.        52000168                        $219.95        Fits ’15-later XG models.

The seat moves the rider approximately 1.5" lower        and 1.25" forward and the 1.25" slimmer front profile brings        the legs closer together for an easier reach to the ground at a        stop. The Reach Seat features a stepped profile that keeps the        rider from sliding back during acceleration.        52000123                        $199.95        Fits ’15-later XG models.

Designed to        move the rider 1.25" up and 2.5" back from the stock seating        position, a Tallboy Seat can eliminate the “knees-high” riding        position and effectively places the body for a natural arm and        leg reach to the controls.        52000124                        $199.95        Fits ’15-later XG models.

Five big and beefy spokes define the distinctive        hot rod styling and the knife-edge shape provides an angu-        lar spin on the traditional custom wheel look.

BADLANDER CUSTOM SEAT        NOTE: Some Harley-Davidson seats are made of leather. Fine        leathers or other natural materials WILL gain “character,” such        as wrinkles or wear, with age. This is normal. A fine, aged        patina and character wrinkles are a sign of the extremely high        quality materials used to construct your seat or backrest. The        appearance of scars or marks on the leather are a result of        using natural leather panels and should not be thought of as        an imperfection.

This unique        Combination Speedometer/Tachometer allows you to moni-        tor engine speed without adding additional handlebar-        mounted gauges. The unit mounts in the stock dash opening        and is a direct plug-in installation. The backlit gauges include        a large LCD (liquid crystal display) information screen that        displays odometer/tripmeter data, miles-to-empty readings,        an easy-to-read segmented fuel display, a gear position indica-        tor and clock. This valuable information is available to the rider        at a glance. The gauge features push-button adjustable back-        lighting with over 600 color tone options, allowing the rider        to adjust pointer, LCD and backlighting colors to match any        paint scheme or viewing preference. The digital speed read-        ing can be easily toggled between MPH and kph to simplify        cross-border travel.

THE RAIL COLLECTION        Tough broad shouldered attitude with an edge – that’s what                                   1        you get when you finish your ride with the Rail Collection. We        start with factory engineered components to ensure perfect        fit and function. Then we apply a rich durable gloss black        finish to draw attention to the heart of the bike, and then add        machined longitudinal strakes to provide visual length to the        powertrain. The resulting look is masculine and aggressive –        and it mixes well with either café or urban assault styles. Start        with a couple of components, or go all the way.        1. 25700541  Derby Cover.       $149.95        Fits ’04-later XL models.

Fine leathers or other natural materials WILL gain        “character,” such as wrinkles or wear, with age. This is normal.        A fine, aged patina and character wrinkles are a sign of the        extremely high quality materials used to construct your        saddlebags. The appearance of scars or marks on the leather        are a result of using natural leather panels and should not be        thought of as an imperfection.

RIDER FOOTBOARD KIT        Convert your Dyna  model to touring-oriented footboard-                    ®        based controls. Ideal for riders with an inseam too long for        mid-controls or for riders who prefer the extra foot room on        long rides, this complete kit moves the foot brake and shift        lever forward from the standard position. The installation        places the rider into a comfortable upright posture with a flat        foot and bent knee profile. This position provides additional        support by allowing the legs to take some of the rider’s weight,        while providing the freedom to reposition the feet during the        ride.

LEATHER SADDLEBAGS – ROCKER™ MODELS        Heavy leather saddlebags add a practical twist to this one-of-        a-kind custom motorcycle. The bags are removable with the        simple “lift and slide” motion, so you can dress your bike up        or down depending on your mood, leaving behind the attrac-        tive chrome support structure. The tapered “messenger” style        bags feature traditional strap and buckle details that conceal        quick-release clips for easy access. Designed to complement        the lean look of the Rocker™ motorcycle, the tapered bags sit        low on the bike and wrap the exhaust for a ground-hugging        stance. The bags feature rigid-back shells to maintain their        shape and an expandable side gusset for added capacity        when you need it. Luggage capacity: 1470 cubic inches total        (1910 cubic inches expanded).        90240-08                        $729.95        Fits ’08-’11 FXCW and FXCWC models.

WIND SPLITTER VENTED WINDSHIELD        Reduce helmet buffeting at speed. The Harley-Davidson                                            ®        Detachables™ Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an        exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbu-        lence behind the windscreen. When open, the controlled        airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and        helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and        around the rider. The revised flow reduces helmet bobbing and        neck fatigue so you can comfortably spend more time in the        saddle. The open vent also provides cooling airflow to the rider        at low speeds and in city traffic.        Engineered to provide the riding comfort of a larger windshield,        this low-profile screen’s contemporary contour sets it apart        from the crowd. The shape keeps the windshield below your        site line so you don’t look through bugs and road grime and        the detachable design means you can ride without the shield        when the mood strikes. The shield is formed of hard-coated        polycarbonate for strength and scratch resistance and the        dark-smoked finish reduces glare. The slim polished stain-        less steel brackets mount to the Original Equipment rubber        isolated docking points for ease of installation and removal.        57400176                       $429.95                      ®        Fits ’94-later Road King  models (except FLHRS).

VENTILATOR KING-SIZE H-D  DETACHABLES™                            ®        WINDSHIELD        In a nutshell, a windshield should provide a barrier between        the rider and errant bugs, discarded cigarette butts, flying        debris and bad air. The shield should manage airflow and wind        blasts to create a pocket of still air for both rider and passen-        ger comfort. But if you ride in a warm climate or spend time at        low speeds stuck in traffic, you need to keep some air circu-        lating around your body to stay comfortable. The Ventilator        Windshield features clear injection-molded vents that allow        you to adjust the airflow to match the riding conditions.        Opening the vents redirects the air across your chest for a        cooling effect and closing the vents provides maximum wind   A. WIND SPLITTER VENTED WINDSHIELD        and weather protection. But when you want to ride “naked,”        the detachable shield can be removed completely and rein-        stalled in seconds to match your riding mood.        57400024   21" Clear.           $379.95        Fits ’94-later Road King models.

WIND SPLITTER WINDSHIELD – BATWING FAIRING        In the world of functional performance, size does matter.        After all, it’s simple to understand that the larger the wind-        shield area, the greater the amount of wind deflection. The        Wind Splitter Windshield is a great look for all Touring models        and is shaped for the perfect combination of effective airflow        management and “wow” styling. The sweeping design comple-        ments the shape of the fairing and the inner dash panel and        adds height over a traditional low-profile wind deflector in the        center where it counts. The shape decreases wind noise and        improves your ability to hear the motorcycle’s sound system.        The rich smoked finish does not interfere with your forward        view and looks great against any paint color. The easy-to-        install Wind Splitter features a center-mount Bar & Shield        medallion for a distinctive finishing touch.                                ®                       ®        Fits ’14-later Electra Glide , Street Glide , Ultra Limited and Tri   4.5" DARK SMOKE  7" DARK SMOKE  10" LIGHT SMOKE           ®        Glide  models.        57400204   4.5" Dark Smoke.     $154.95        Does not fit with Windshield Bags or Pouches.        57400205   7" Dark Smoke.       $159.95        Does not fit with Windshield Bags or Pouches.        57400206   10" Light Smoke.     $164.95        Fits ’96-’13 Electra Glide, Street Glide and Trike models.

BATWING SPORT WINDSHIELD        Combine the mini-shield styling of a wind deflector with a little        extra wind protection. This 10.0" Sport Shield features a tradi-        tional wind screen shape, but adds a forward “flip” to the trail-        ing edge to deflect the air flow over the rider.

WIND SPLITTER WINDSHIELD – ROAD GLIDE ®        In the world of functional performance, size does matter.        After all, it’s simple to understand that the larger the wind-        shield area, the greater the amount of wind deflection. The        Wind Splitter Windshield is a great look for all Touring models        and is shaped for the perfect combination of effective air flow        management and “wow” styling. The sweeping design comple-        ments the shape of the fairing and the inner dash panel and        adds height over a traditional low-profile wind deflector in the        center where it counts. The shape decreases wind noise and        improves your ability to hear the motorcycle’s sound system.        The rich smoked finish does not interfere with your forward        view and looks great against any paint color. The easy-to-        install Wind Splitter features a center-mount Bar & Shield        medallion for a distinctive finishing touch.                      ®        Fits ’15-later Road Glide  models.

Beneath the        two inches of traditional dual-density foam, the rider's weight        is supported by a revolutionary fabric suspension system.

This internal system prevents “bottoming        out” and provides a 30% improvement in comfort and endur-        ance over the long haul by sheltering the rider from pothole        and highway expansion joint impacts.

This remarkable                               ®        seat removes pressure points and “hot spots” by adjusting the        amount of air contained in each bladder within the seat.

On a long run, occasionally inflating        and deflating the air bladders reduces the “numb butt” effect        by improving the blood flow to the extremities. So grab a seat.

The lamps act as a supple-                      ®        ment to the Tour-Pak  luggage mounted rear lighting. The        lamps are housed in a low-profile frame that is contoured        to hug the curve of the hard saddlebags. The self-adhesive        lamps fit seamlessly beneath the saddlebag lid and add a styl-        ish touch of color, even when the bike is parked.

The crystal-clear material        protects the paint without changing the overall look of your        bike. And the optical properties of the material disguise minor        scuffs and scratches. The application process is similar to        that of tinted window film and the material can be removed        and replaced when it is no longer cosmetically appealing.        Scratches to paint can be expensive to repair but scratches to        this film can be removed by applying a small amount of heat        with a heat gun.      A.

PREMIUM RIDE HAND-ADJUSTABLE        TOURING SHOCKS*        Experience the ultimate in superior ride quality with these        Premium Touring Shocks. These shocks utilize a single        tube, nitrogen charged emulsion design. The design offers        enhanced compression and rebound damping compared        to the Original Equipment-style air adjustable shocks. This        provides a controlled yet plush ride with much less bottoming.        Larger chambers (40mm diameter pistons and 14mm rods)        allow these shocks to react more quickly to impacts. This        keeps the tires tracking while minimizing harshness transmit-        ted through the frame. A simple knob behind the left saddle-        bag allows the rider to conveniently modify the spring preload        via a hydraulic adjuster.

PASSENGER MINI FOOTBOARD        MOUNT KIT – TOURING MODELS        This mount kit permits replacement of the Original Equipment        passenger footboards with footpegs or mini footboards, and        moves the passenger’s foot rearward and inward to give the        rider more space between the rider footboard and the passen-        ger foot support. The new position clears the path for your feet        to ease walking the bike in and out of parking spaces. When        folded, the pegs are tighter to the bike to reduce the chance of        contacting the passenger foot support with your calf.

They are the primary      means by which you can tune your engine’s horsepower and torque output. Every      cam has unique lift and overlap performance characteristics, which means you      need to select cams based on exactly the kind of power you’re looking for.      While hot cams, higher-ﬂ owing cylinder heads and a free-ﬂ owing exhaust      system will move the peaks higher up the rpm band, conservative cams may      feel stronger to a street rider because the maximum torque occurs at lower rpm.                                      ®      The experts at your Harley-Davidson  dealer have the knowledge, skill and      experience to recommend the optimum cam speciﬁ cations for your      riding demands.

CRATE ENGINE SHORTBLOCK ASSEMBLY – DYNA AND TOURING        When high-performance engine modifications are made, the        increased torque is transferred via the crankshaft to the drive        system, putting a significantly higher load on the bearing. The        Lefty Bearing is case-hardened on the inner and outer race        to provide increased load capacity and enhanced durability        in high-torque applications. The bearing is installed in the left        side of the crankcase and supports the output shaft to the        primary drive system.        24004-03B                       $45.95        Fits ’03-later Twin Cam-equipped models.                           ®      C.

Clutch is designed to        improve engagement grip and provides minor slippage during        downshifting to reduce shock to the power train. Reduces        hand lever pull effort by over 1 pound. Complete kit features        improved clutch plates for enhanced wear resistance and is        the perfect addition when installing a high-output Screamin’        Eagle Stage Kit.        37000026                        $389.95        Fits ’14-later Touring and Trike models with hydraulic        clutch actuator.      B. SCREAMIN’ EAGLE VARIABLE PRESSURE CLUTCH  2        Get more performance from the Original Equipment clutch.        The Screamin’ Eagle Variable Pressure Clutch is designed to        help put the added power from a Screamin’ Eagle Stage Kit        to the pavement. This bolt-on kit harnesses the centrifugal        force of spinning weights to increase the clutch capacity as        engine speed increases. The mechanism applies increasing        pressure to the stock clutch pressure plate as RPM rises. The        result: High torque-handling capabilities without increasing        clutch lever effort at idle. The Variable Pressure Clutch also        provides smoother clutch disengagement at lower speed. Kit        fits behind most stock derby covers with no modifications.        See installation manual for additional accessory derby cover        fitment information.        To match the performance demands of your engine, team the        Variable Pressure Clutch with your choice of clutch diaphragm        springs.

Warm hands have a major impact on overall body comfort        and sometimes gloves just aren’t enough. These thermostati-        cally controlled grips feature variable heat settings controlled        with a military grade resistor and use automatic tempera-        ture monitoring to adjust to ambient temperatures. With both        hands on the grips, they will remain at a constant tempera-        ture regardless of changes in outside temperature. The self-        contained control circuit and control knob means you have        no additional switches or controller boxes to mount and the        grips are switched on/off with the ignition to avoid draining        your battery. The “glueless” grip design allows grip removal if        you change handlebars or motorcycles.      A.

These grips combine a traction-grip crosshatch rubber        surface with a comfortable 1.6" diameter for excellent control        in wet or dry weather. These grips have been thermally        mapped to provide a more uniform heat and are designed to        achieve a maximum operating temperature approximately 20°        Fahrenheit warmer than previous accessory heated grips for        added warmth during cold rides.

Adding risers to      bars that sit too low can help put hand grips into your sweet spot.      PULL BACK is the distance the handlebar tips come back toward the rider. Greater      pull back can eliminate the long reach to the bar for a shorter rider.      WIDTH is measured from tip-to-tip. Make sure the bar isn’t too wide so it pulls      your hands off the grips when turning.      KNURL CENTER is the distance between the centerline of the bar’s knurling. The      measurement should match the riser dimension to maximize clamping pressure.

Selected to complement        the style or use of the bike, the handlebar may be the ideal        shape for many riders, but of course, not everyone has the        same physical characteristics.        Choosing a bar for your batwing fairing-equipped model is        about more than just style – it’s about how you approach the        road. Where the bar positions your hands, wrists, and arms        directly affects how you feel on your motorcycle. For every        set of bars, there are three factors at work: Rise, Pullback and        width. These three measurements determine your reach to        the hand controls and, therefore your overall feeling of comfort        and control.      A.

BOOM!™ AUDIO AMPLIFIER KIT        Take your music to the streets. Boom!™ Audio Amplifier        Kits allow you to crank up the volume with significantly less        distortion. The amplifier provides more power than Original        Equipment radio alone, resulting in increased volume, fuller        sound reproduction, reduced clipping and lower  Total        Harmonic Distortion (THD) than head unit alone. Unlike after-        market amplifiers that connect between the radio and the        speakers, the Boom! Audio amplifier bypasses the radio’s        internal power amp to produce the cleanest sound possi-        ble. The Boom! Audio Amplifier boosts the pure source signal,        minimizing any distortion generated through the speaker        output. The system-matched high-output signal features        optimized sound equalization for crisp, clear vocals and        maximum bass response and the strong midrange response        cuts through wind and road noise. The waterproof 4-chan-        nel, 75-watts/channel amplifier (300-watt total) has been        designed from the ground-up for the harsh motorcycle envi-        ronment. Fairing Mounted kit includes all mounting hard-        ware and wiring harness. Note: The use of the Boom! Audio        Amplifier turns off the radio’s internal amplifier.        76000278   Fairing Mounted.     $599.95        Fits ’14-later Electra Glide , Street Glide , Ultra Limited and                                ®                        ®        Tri Glide  models equipped with a Boom!

AUDIO SYSTEMS              ™        Boom!  Audio Stage II systems give you the very best motorcycle sound        experience. Stage II systems are based on a bi-ampliﬁ ed, three-way speaker        design. Each Stage II speaker features a separate woofer, mid-range, and        tweeter element that allow frequencies to be delivered with the optimum driver        design. Each speaker is powered by two channels from the ampliﬁ er – one for        the woofer, and the second for the mid-range/tweeter combination – for a to-        tal output of 150 watts/speaker. This doubling of the power allows you to play        your music louder with far less distortion than traditional systems.

Audio Stage I speakers feature larger woofers for deeper bass and soft-dome      tweeters for better balanced sound quality. Efﬁ cient Stage I speakers can be      easily powered with the built-in ampliﬁ er in the factory-installed Boom Box      Infotainment System, or with the addition of Boom!™ Audio ampliﬁ ers, the      larger speakers can produce more volume at all frequencies. A custom EQ      was developed for each conﬁ guration of speakers to get the most out of the      Stage I system.                                               BOOM!

DAYMAKER™ REFLECTOR LED FOG LAMPS        Compact 2.5" bullet-shaped reflector-optics fog lamps        produce a bright white pool of light near the vehicle and fill        in the dark area between the bike and the low-beam pattern.        The fog lamps project a smooth light pattern spread without        distracting “hot spots” and the natural “daylight” lamp color        enhances and amplifies the reflective character of lane mark-        ers. Unlike some traditional fog lamps, the low-draw LED        lamps do not burden the bike’s electrical system. The long-        life solid-state LED lamps are sealed in shock and vibration-        resistant housings that mount to the engine guard or the Road        Glide  fairing for a clean appearance. Fog lamps are DOT and           ®        ECE compliant.                   ®              ®        Fits Dyna , Softail , Touring and Trike models equipped with        1.25" diameter Engine Guards.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON  1.5" GRADUAL RELEASE RATCHET        TIE-DOWN STRAPS        600 lbs Working Load – 1.5" x 66"        These heavy duty ratchet straps provide maximum tension-        ing power and a higher working load capacity with the added        benefit of being able to release the tension one click at a time.        The ratchet is built with a comfortable molded grip handle        and a dual-direction reversing drive that permits the spin-        dle to rotate backwards releasing tension until it reaches        60 lbs. This option helps eliminate the “snap back” release        common with most standard ratchet designs under heavy        load and also permits the even tensioning of straps without        having to release all of the webbing and start over. The strap        also features heavy duty 6,000 lbs abrasion resistant Nylon        webbing, a built in Soft Hook with vinyl coated full size “S”        hook on the fixed end and an large closed end carabiner hook        on the adjustable end to keep it hooked securely during the        tie-down process.

TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE AND FILL VALVE        Simplify checking the air pressure level and filling the tires on        your motorcycle. This Tire Pressure Gauge features a an 18"        flexible hose and 2-way air chuck with both a 45° fill port and        a unique side fill port that provides easy straight-in access to        hard-to-reach motorcycle valve stems. The dual-range instant-        read gauge measures pressures from 0-60 psi and 0-400 kPa,        and is protected from impact and abrasion by a thick rubber        collar. Designed to fit an air compressor with a standard 1/4"        quick-disconnect coupler, this gauge allows you to check the        pressure and fill the tire without removing the chuck from the        tire. Just apply the chuck to the valve stem, read the pressure,        and add air by depressing the comfortable trigger leaver. And        for checking tire pressure on the road, you can use this tool        like any standard tire gauge.        12700096                        $79.95      B. COMPACT AIR COMPRESSOR WITH LIGHT        Correct tire pressure is crucial to safe operation and long tire        life, but checking the pressure, finding a gas station with a        working air pump, and filling the tire is a chore that many of us        ignore. The Compact Air Compressor is designed to simplify        this necessary procedure. The compact, lightweight 12V pump        is designed for life on the road. The all-in-one pump plugs into   A.

The 11"        air hose and 6' fuse-protected power cord easily reach the        front and rear wheels, and are stored in convenient compart-        ments when not in use. The lightweight pump features dura-  NEW        ble, impact-resistant construction, and is small enough to fit        easily in a saddlebag or strap-on luggage. Kit includes pump,        valve stem extension, and nylon carrying bag.        12700020                        $42.95      C. VALVE STEM EXTENSION        Sometimes there’s just not enough space around the tire’s        valve stem for the gas station air chuck and hose to reach.        Brake rotors, sprockets and saddlebags get in the way and        keep the air chuck from making an airtight seal. When that        happens, this Valve Stem Extension provides easy access.        Simply screw the extension in place on the stem, fill the tire        to the proper pressure, remove the extension, and replace the        valve stem cap. Then toss the extension in your saddlebag or        tool roll for the next time.        42300009                         $10.95                                                                  A.
