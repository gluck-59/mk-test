Cruiseliner Saddlebags are styled to flow with      the lines of the rear fender. Unlike other bags,      Cruiseliners are not bilaterally symmetrical. This      enables a tight fit and streamlined styling.      Cruiseliner Saddlebags open easily with a lock-      ing pushbutton that flips the lid forward for easy      access to your cargo. The hinge permanently      fastens the lid to the bag. The interior walls, lid,      and rubber seal are designed to keep the con-      tents safe and dry.      Cruiseliner bags are made from an impact      resistant, rugged polymer blend and come pre-      painted gloss black.      Model-specific mount kits are sold separately.
