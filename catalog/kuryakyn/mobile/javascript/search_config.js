Our catalog is now structured & organized by motorcycle brands to help you easily find the right                                accessories for your ride. There’s also a new section called MULTI-FIT. This section is composed of                                accessories that are made to fit multiple brands. For example, many Küryakyn Grips & Footpegs are                                designed to fit more than one brand. You’ll also find call-outs throughout the book letting you know                                where to find related or additional accessories, as well as more information relating to that product.","             KÜryaKyn is proud to        support our armed services           Thank you To ThE mEn and          womEn – pasT, prEsEnT and              fuTurE – who havE puT         ThEmsElvEs in harm’s way To              proTEcT our frEEdoms               We are honored                to ride with you","                                                                               Found in this Section:                                                                                                       audio 7                                                                                                    LiGHtinG 7                                                                                        HandLeBar controLs 9                                                                                              Foot controLs 10                                                                                     covers, trims & accents 11                                                                                          tourinG & comFort 14                                                                                  Find more accessories For  89                                                                                    your victory in muLti-Fit                                                                                                                   3                                   VICTORY                                 fOR","              Laydown curved             13                 License pLate                                                                                      tourinG & comFort 14                                                                                            (not sHown BeLow)      4                            enGine cHrome 12","                             CROSS COUNTRY                        fOR                                                mirrors 112                                audio 7        HandLeBar controLs 9                                                                                                  Front end LiGHtinG 7                                                                                                                   5          Foot controLs & cruise peGs 10                                                         covers, trims & accents 11","                    11                                                                                           14                                   Sneak Peak                     New Accessories for Victory in the Works                    waTch www.kuryakyn.com for morE informaTion & rElEasE daTEs                                                    products are patent pending     6               www. k uryakyn.com                  866.277.9598","        Audio                                                                                                          victory        Audio                                 KicKer Kps52504                                 4 oHm speaKers                                                             accessories for                                 weather-proof, high-efficiency                                              victory                                 coaxials specifically created as fairing                                 drop-ins or as replacements for rear                                 speakers on victory bikes equipped with stock                                 speakers.
